## Sitting Ducks

Sitting Ducks is a puzzle game that my brother and I made for the [Quinnipiac Game Dev Club eJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/quinnipiac-game-dev-club-ejam-2020). We made the game using Unity, and it is programmed in C#. I ended up making most of the art assets and level designs myself, and also helped out with some of the code. We had many issues with collisions not being detected or happening at strange times, but for a first game, I was proud of what we were able to make. We ended up placing first the category for "Representation of the Jam's Theme". You can play the game in your browser [here](./game).

## Digital Privacy: Password Manager

Digital Privacy: Password Manager is a simple console program my brother and I made for the Quinnipiac Computing Club Hackathon during the Fall 2020 semester. It encrypts and decrypts passwords using 128-bit AES encryption, and stores them in a text file which it can read from later on. This program was written in Scala, although I used some Java packages and functions for the encryption-related functionality. This program was made in less than 9 hours, with no prior knowledge of encryption and minimal experience with file input/output in Scala. We ended up placing second in the hackathon, and I was very happy with how the program turned out. The presentation we gave during the hackathon is also included in the repository.

## COVID-CT: Starlight Saviors

COVID-CT: Starlight Saviors is a fork of [a machine learning model made by UCSD](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT). This was one of the largest projects I received at my second internship at DreamPort. The project is mostly written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. I was a member of Team 3, which was in charge of finding and implementing a larger dataset for the machine learning algorithm to train on. I was also in charge of writing [the LaTeX document for my team](https://github.com/walkerjbuckle/COVID-CT-Starlight-Saviors/blob/b6e8c0cbbe5cf0136a4179754237b1aa5bd51b46/docs/COVID-CT%20Starlight%20Saviors%20Team%203%20-%20Dataset%20Expansion.pdf) to summarize our work. This project was a great learning experience for me, as it introduced me to many new topics, tools, and concepts.
