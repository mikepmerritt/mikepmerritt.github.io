## Computer Science Experience and Education

I first started learning computer science in eighth grade. We were allowed to do whatever we wanted as a final project for our media class, so I decided to teach myself how to make a basic game using Python. After months of working on that game, I decided programming was something I wanted to focus on learning, so I decided to pursue as many opportunities as I could in the future. At my high school, [St. Vincent Pallotti High School](https://www.pallottihs.org/), I took both AP Computer Science classes and received a 5 on each, and was also a team captain on my school's FTC Robotics team (Pallotti Robotics Team #12342) for all four years of high school. I graduated as co-valedictorian of my class and went to [Quinnipiac University](https://www.qu.edu/) in Connecticut to continue studying computer science and programming.

I have programmed in several different languages, such as Python, Java, JavaScript, Scala, and C#, and have also worked with other tools such as Git, GitHub, AWS, Splunk, and Elastic. I have participated in two internships with the [Maryland Innovation and Security Institute](https://misi.tech/) at [DreamPort](https://dreamport.tech/). During these internships, I was able to get some hands-on experience with more complicated computer science topics such as facial recognition and working with neural networks. I got to work with industry-standard tools such as AWS, Splunk, and Elastic, and also got to talk with several computer science and cybersecurity experts.

## Additional Information

Some of my interests include programming, robotics, and both playing and making video games. I am a member of the Quinnipiac Computing Club and the Quinnipiac Game Developers Club. I began participating in game jams starting with the Quinnipiac Game Dev Club eJam 2020. You can find more about my game development at [my itch.io page](https://meepix.itch.io/).
